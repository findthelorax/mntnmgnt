# Ski Patrol Management System

This is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) built with React for managing Ski Patrol Documents and logs for a Ski Mountain. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing various aspects of ski patrol operations.

## Features

-   **Patrol Documents and Logs**: Keep track of all patrol activities and incidents with a robust logging system.

-   **Incident Logs**: Record and access detailed incident reports to ensure safety and accountability.

-   **Lifts and Lift Line Checks**: Manage and monitor the status of all ski lifts.

-   **Equipment Management**: Keep track of all ski patrol equipment.

-   **Huts Management**: Manage all huts on the ski mountain.

Here are some best practices for developing a React Progressive Web App (PWA) with TypeScript:

Use TypeScript Interfaces and Types: TypeScript provides static types to ensure your code behaves as expected. Use interfaces and types to define the shape of your data.

Leverage TypeScript's Strict Mode: Enable strict mode in your tsconfig.json to enforce stricter type checking and stricter property initialization checks.

Use Functional Components with Hooks: React Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. This makes your code more readable and easier to test.

Service Worker Caching: Properly configure your service worker to cache the application shell (app shell) so that your app can work offline.

Manifest File: Ensure your manifest.json file is properly configured. This file controls how your app appears to the user and ensures that your app is discoverable as a PWA.

Responsive Design: Your PWA should be responsive and provide a consistent experience across different devices and screen sizes.

Performance: Use code splitting and lazy loading to improve the initial load time of your app. Tools like Lighthouse can help you audit your PWA for performance and other best practices.

Testing: Write unit tests for your components and service workers. Tools like Jest can be used for testing in React applications.

Accessibility: Ensure your PWA is accessible to all users. Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary, and test your app with accessibility tools.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Automate your testing and deployment process to catch errors quickly and ensure your code is always in a deployable state.
